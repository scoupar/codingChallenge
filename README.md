# Requirements

The requirements of this challenge were as follows: Given an array of length >= 0, and a positive integer N, return the contents of the array divided into N equally sized arrays.

Where the size of the original array cannot be divided equally by N, the final part should have a length equal to the
remainder.

# Executing the code

To execute the code please enter the command 'node codingChallenge.js' in the command line. The result will be printed in the terminal. The array and n values can be altered to give different results. 

# Running the unit tests

The unit testing is handled by Jest, please use 'NPM i' to install this as a dependency if you wish to run the unit tests.
